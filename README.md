# Step №1. The Goal of our Project
The scope of our project is the financial market. We want to reach accurate prediction for future prices of more than 400 shares of different companies. They were chosen not accidentally: we decided to focus on 4 sectors.
* Industrials
* Renewable Energy
* Financial Services
* Healthcare

Due to their incohesion, we expect them to be uncorrelated, so models can be trained in each sector separatly. Our final product is a _telegram bot_ that can predict prices.

write in general about models, desired result (how it's going to look like)

# Step №2. Parsing
Data for the final dataset was taken from: [FMP API](https://site.financialmodelingprep.com/developer/docs) (US stock parsing), [Alpha Vantage API](https://www.alphavantage.co/) (US macro statistic), [FED](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/reference-rates/effr) (Effective Federal Funds Rate), [CBR](https://www.cbr.ru/statistics/) (Russian monetary statistics), [Federal State Statistics Service](https://eng.rosstat.gov.ru/) (Russian GDP), [ApiMoex](https://pypi.org/project/apimoex/) (RU stock parsing)
