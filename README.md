# Step №1. The Goal of our Project
The scope of our project is the financial market. We want to reach accurate prediction for future prices of more than 400 shares of different companies. They were chosen not accidentally: we decided to focus on 4 sectors.
* Industrials
* Renewable Energy
* Financial Services
* Healthcare

write in general about models, desired result (how it's going to look like)

# Step №2. Parsing
Data for the final dataset was taken from: ...
Dataset Overview... (write about all features and the logic of adding them for this project)

# Step №3. Data processing


# Step №4. Visualisation


# Step №5. Feature engineering


# Step №6. Hypotheses


# Step №7. Machine Learning
Here we've built a forecasting ML model. Description of models + result

# Our team:
1) Nikita Chuikin (maybe I've made a mistake, sorry)
2) Andrew Nizov
